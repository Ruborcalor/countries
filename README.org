* Features

This is a web project that displays simple country data retrieved from the public REST Countries API https://restcountries.eu.

- Displays all the countries with a grid of cards. Each card allows a user to visualize the flag image, the name, the population, and the region.
- A text field for filtering countries by name.
- A form group of checkboxes for filtering countries by region.
- The ability to click on a country's card in order to display the full information about that country.
- Lazy loading. This means that rather than displaying all 250 countries at once, it only displays a few at first. Then when the user scrolls down it loads more into the display.
- Theme switching (dark and light).
- Responsive web design (mobile and desktop).
- An indication of the number of matching countries.
- A basic custom favicon.
